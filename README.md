## Contribute

Vivaldi Forum mod is a community project driven by the ideas and needs of its users. Without users, there's no reason for development. Thus the most straightforward way to help out is installing and using the extension, providing feedback and spotlighting issues.

### Themes

Did you create a beautiful theme with help of the Theme Machine? Great! Please share it by using the **Export** button on the options page, uploading the file (for example to Dropbox) and posting the link in the feedback topic on Vivaldi Forum. Did you introduce additional changes with User CSS? Just copy the code and paste it alongside your theme.

You can also create a standalone community theme:

* Download or clone the repository.
* On Vivaldi's extensions page enable developer mode, click **Load unpacked** and select the Vivaldi Forum mod directory.
* Select **Standard** theme in options, open `standard.css` (located in `vivaldi_forum_mod/themes`) in a text editor and start designing your new theme.
* Submit the code for review. Contact through Vivaldi Forum directly, either through the feedback topic, or by sending a [message](https://forum.vivaldi.net/user/luetage).

### Translations

Vivaldi Forum mod 2.0 will introduce translations. The translations are active on the [testing branch](https://github.com/luetage/vivaldi_forum_mod/tree/testing) and following languages are currently being worked on:

* French
* German
* Italian
* Spanish

You can help out by improving these translations, or by introducing a new translation. Here's a quick **how to**:

* Please make sure the language you want to translate to is [supported](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/i18n?csw=1#localeTable).
* Download or clone the testing branch (link above).
* On Vivaldi's extensions page enable developer mode, click **Load unpacked** and select the Vivaldi Forum mod directory.
* In Vivaldi browser settings, go to **Startup** and select your desired target language. Restart the browser.
* In Vivaldi Forum settings pick your target language, hit **Save** and reload the tab.
* Create a new directory in `vivaldi_forum_mod/_locales` and rename it (locale code).
* Make a copy of the English translation file (`vivaldi_forum_mod/_locales/en/messages.json`) and paste it into your newly created translation directory.
* Open the `messages.json` file in a text editor and start translating.

Each entry in the file has a **message** and a **description** part. Only translate the message to your target language, leave everything else untouched. Descriptions which start with the word **Options** are translations for Vivaldi Forum mod's options page, anything else appears on Vivaldi Forum directly. Make sure to check out existing translations on Vivaldi Forum and to enable the different modifications to see your translations in action. If you should have any question about this procedure, or if you need help of any kind, please write a post in the feedback topic or send a [message](https://forum.vivaldi.net/user/luetage). Each translation should at least be checked by one other contributor to assure its accuracy. Finished translations will be released as soon as you submit them. Either make a pull request on Github directly, or submit the `messages.json` file by pasting its contents online (eg [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/)) and sharing the link.
